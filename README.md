### Hey, I'm Mateusz ðŸ‘‹  
#### Senior Angular Developer  &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;  Poland

I'm a passionate and detail-oriented software developer with several years of experience crafting modern web applications.  
Currently focused on **Angular** and everything around building performant, scalable, and maintainable frontends.

I'm also diving deeper into the backend side of things with **NestJS**, aiming to become a more versatile full-stack developer.
